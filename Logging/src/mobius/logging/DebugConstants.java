/**
 * <p> <code>DebugConstants</code> is an interface that collects the
 * various constants of the debugging package including debug level ranges,
 * standard debugging messages, statistics definitions, etc. </p>
 *
 * <p> This interface can be implemented or the default implementation of
 * it can be sub-typed to modify the various values contained herein for
 * specific debugging sub-packages, applications, etc. </p>
 *
 * <p> An example of such a sub-type is included as
 * <code>FrenchConstants</code>. </p>
 *
 * <p> The default categories are specified in the following table.
 * <table align="abscenter" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
 * <tr>
 * <td> <strong>Category</strong> </td>
 * <td> <strong>Level</strong> </td>
 * <td> <strong>Description</strong> </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td> ASSERTION </td>
 * <td> 9 </td>
 * <td> The highest level category that exists.  Assertions are predicates
 * that <strong>must</strong> be true.  If an assertion is false, a stack
 * dump takes place and the object in question should shut down in an
 * orderly fashion.  Note that a single assertion should be made for each
 * predicate that is in the precondition, postcondition, requires, and
 * ensures expressions for every method. </td>

 * <td> FAILURE </td>
 * <td> 9 </td>
 * <td> The highest level category that exists.  Sometimes a object need
 * fail outside an assertion.  This default category provides this
 * functionality.  If a failure is seen, a stack dump takes place and the
 * object in question should shut down in an orderly fashion.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td> CRITICAL </td>
 * <td> 7 </td>
 * <td> Very important problems/errors that will eventually cause Failures
 * or Assertions should be tagged as Critical.  The user/system must be
 * information of such problems but the object in question need not shut
 * down immediately and can potentially recover.  Typical examples of
 * Critical errors are resource-related errors (out of memory, disk space,
 * CPU time, etc.).</td>

 * <tr>
 * <td> ERROR </td>
 * <td> 5 </td>
